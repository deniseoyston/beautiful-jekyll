#### Drunk On Licensed Premises

At the North Riding Police-court yesterday, William Bell, labourer, Ruston, was summoned for being drunk on licensed premises at Wykeham on 11th inst.  Sergeant Harmby said he visited the Downe Arms and found the defendant laid drunk on the floor with his head on the fender.  He called the landlord's attention to him, and he was taken away by two men.  The landlord said that he had only had two pints of beer in his house. He was fined 10s. and the costs.-- David Haw, the landlord, was summoned for permitting the drunkenness.  Defendant said he did not discern that Bell was the worse for liquor when he entered the premises, but in becoming cognisant of his condition he requested him to leave, which, however, he declined to do, and not having assistance at hand he could not eject him.  Bell was quiet.  The Bench fined defendant 40s. and 9s. costs, he having previously been fined for a like 
offence.
