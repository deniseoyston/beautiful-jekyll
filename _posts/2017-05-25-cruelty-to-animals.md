#### CRUELTY TO ANIMALS
At the Borough Police Court on Saturday, before the Mayor and other magistrates, Francis Prince, West Ayton, miller and George Atkinson, his servant, were charged, the former with causing to be worked and the latter with working a horse while in an unfit state by reason of lameness on the 3rd inst.  Inspector Lucas proved the offence, and said the horse was very lame indeed, and defendants could not help being aware of it.  Mr. Prince, who said he gave forty guineas for the horse, admitted the horse was a bit lame on the day named, but when he sent it out was of opinion that it would work off.  He also urged that on account of being summoned he had not attempted to work the horse, and it had since died.  The horse had previously, frequently shown signs of lameness in a morning, but it always had worked off, and that the horse was quite lively when at work.  Mr Prince was fined 6s and 5s costs, the case against his servant not being proved.
