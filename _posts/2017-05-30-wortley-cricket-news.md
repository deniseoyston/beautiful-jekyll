##### Charles Oyston - Cricketer

For the season of 1895 a strong working committee has been chosen, whose sole desire and strong ambition it is to reverse the results arrived in the last year.  No doubt all will remember that Wortley figured very poorly in last year's League fixtures, being at the bottom of the clubs connected with the Leeds League.  These, of course, have to be again met, and, in addition the fixture list includes matches with, Morley, Farsley, Pudsey Britannia, Otley, Rastrick and the Leeds Constabulary. Most of the old players including, Bannister, Whitaker, Garnett, Hudson, Sowry, Ross, Fearnley etc., intend rendering service again; while from outside a few very good applications have been received for first and second teams. **Charles Oyston**, their late professional, will be lost as he goes to Morley this year but his place will be filled by John Crabtree, who has done good work previously for the Cheshire Gentlemen and Bowling Old Lane.  The ground committee along with their old and tried servant, F. Duce, are paying close attention to the pitch, and they hope to be able to get ready a good wicket by the time the season commences.
