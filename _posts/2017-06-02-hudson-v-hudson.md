The above cases were again proceeded with.   The first action was brought by the plaintiff, who resides at Hutton Buscel, to recover compensation for injury, alleged to have arisen by reason of a libel, and the second action was for an assault.  The jury retired for forty minutes and they found a verdict for the plaintiff in the first action - damages a Farthing : and for the defendant in the second action.
