###### Review of Kindle version

This is the first book of the Merrily Watkins series that I have read.  I found it very easy to read and very enjoyable, though not as spooky as I imagined the books would be.

I wanted to read this series, the area interests me, having links with the Wye Valley and having spent lovely days in Ross, Hay and Tintern Abbey, plus a very cold one in Hereford.

I didn't realise until I started reading the book that it is very late in the series.  I did not really know or understand the characters or realise the significance of back-references to characters and events from earlier books.  I do not think this overly affected my enjoyment but would recommend new readers to start with the first book and proceed more chronologically than I.

As a consequence of discovering how far through the series I was, I have started blogging series orders of authors that I read.
