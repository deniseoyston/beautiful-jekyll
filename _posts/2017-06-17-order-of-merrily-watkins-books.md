##### Merrily Watkins Series

These books are crime novels with a twist.  Merrily Watkins is a vicar who performs deliverance sessions, formerly known as exorcism.  If you like crime thrillers and ghost stories; these are for you.

> While the books can be read individually it is probably helpful to read the earlier ones first, to get to know the characters who appear through the series.  See my review of **Friends of The Dusk**
