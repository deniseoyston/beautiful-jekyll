###### Review of Kindle version

I like reading thrillers and murder mysteries; I always try to work out who has done it and derive a short list.  Most times I am right.  This book left me clueless.  I had a list of four possible culprits, and I could not have been more wrong.

Silent Scream is the best thriller I have read in years and at 99p for the Kindle edition is an absolute bargain. If Angela Marsons can maintain the quality of her first book, she is an author worth watching.

Child abuse and murder in a children's home is not an easy subject matter, and there were times the book made me squirm.  However, I could not put it down, and I fell straight into some well-laid author traps, only to discover I was hopelessly wrong.  

This book deserves more accolades; a great TV drama perhaps?  After 9 o'clock of course!
