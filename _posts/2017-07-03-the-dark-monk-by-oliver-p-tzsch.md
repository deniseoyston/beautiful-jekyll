###### Review of Kindle version

I purchased [The Dark Monk](http://amzn.to/2t5PwFc) after reading [The Hangman's Daughter](http://amzn.to/2teZCBZ).  I am loving this series set in seventeenth-century Bavaria.  I wonder if the books are made more enjoyable by the fact that the author is a descendant of the eponymous hangman, Jakob Kuisl.

The Dark Monk is an exploration of ancient churches, almost a treasure hunt of churches found through cryptic clues.  Lurking in the background is the mysticism of The Templars, and a race to find ancient treasure.

Of course, these books would be incomplete without depictions of medieval torture and execution.  There is a description of the horrors of execution on the wheel.  Jacob Kuisl is portrayed as a family man, just doing a job, and doing it as humanely as possible.

The book ends with a depiction of how to Rfind places in the book today.  This could be useful for anyone intending to tour Bavaria.

I am looking forward to reading the next episode of this great series.
