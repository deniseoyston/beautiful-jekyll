###### Review of Kindle version

Biography has never been my thing, but this book was difficult to put down.  Neurosurgery seems like the pin-up job in a hospital.  I had an image of a Neurosurgeon being stuffy, unapproachable and having a high opinion of themselves.

Henry Marsh gives us the view of people who realise that their power is God like, but show human failings in knowing that a person's life or well-being depend on your accuracy to the millimetre.

He describes his emotions and feelings on finding his baby son was seriously ill as a means of understanding how it feels to have a job with such responsibility and risk.

The problems of the NHS appear insignificant compared with his experience of working in a Ukrainian hospital.  Where patients' and families' fears are the same, but their prospects are dependent on ageing equipment and methods. 

Most of the chapters are named after various benign and malignant tumours of the brain.  This reminds us of the many things that can go wrong and equally what amazingly complex and delicate organs our brain are.

The reader is left in no doubt that if they needed brain surgery, they would be safe with Henry Marsh.
