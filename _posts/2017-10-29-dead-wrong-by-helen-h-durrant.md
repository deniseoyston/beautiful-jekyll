###### Review of Kindle version

This is my first "Prime Reading" book.  I think I may read too many thrillers, because I knew who the murderer was from the second chapter.  However, this did not stop my enjoyment of this book.  It is a very easy reading, and graphic novel.  Potentially too graphic for bedtime reading, but I managed anyway.  

Living on the Pennine edge of West Yorkshire, at times trying to deduce where the places in the book are was more interesting than the plot itself.  

£1.99 for the Kindle version, represents good value; if I had paid £5.99 for the paperback, I would feel let down.  As free reading on my Prime membership it's a bargain.

In short a great book to borrow for free, but it will never challenge great thriller writers.
