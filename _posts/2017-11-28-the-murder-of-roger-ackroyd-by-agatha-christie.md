###### Review of Kindle version

The book that changed crime fiction forever.  I knew the premise and reputation of this book before I read it.  In case you do not, I am not going to give the game away.  

This book is a very clever and subtle piece of plotting.  If you want to write crime fiction, grab a copy and learn the art.  See how many traps you fall into and how plausible and obvious the truth.
